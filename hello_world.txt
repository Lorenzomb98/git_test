Hello World. This is Lorenzo speaking.
This is the start of my journey to become a full-stack developer.
Lorenzo of the future, if you read this in the future, just know that I am proud of the effort you have put it and the determination you have.
Take some time to remember how things were when you wrote this. 
I am grateful for what I have and what my life is now. Remember to be grateful for what you have and what your life is then. 
See you in the future (when you read this, the present) 
Au revoir!
